# Creating/managing databases

MOLGENIS allows you to create multiple databases on one server.

When you go to the root of you server you will see listing of the databases. If you don't have permission to see any of
the databases then a warning will be shown.

If you cannot find it please go to http://servername/apps/central

If you have admin permissions you can create new databases using the '+' sign.
